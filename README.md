# Kaleidoscope Tutorial
This repository is just a literate programming-like attempt to run
through
the [LLVM Tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/LangImpl01.html) in
C++. 

# Reading
Open the `compiler.org` file in this repository. Readable as markdown
on Github. Or if you just want to see the source with no annotations,
it's in `compiler.cpp`.

# Building 
This is not really designed to be built by others. It requires Emacs
for OSX, but if you have that, you can just run `make`.
